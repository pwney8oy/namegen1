# Introduction #

I need help from anyone who knows how to use PyGtk efficiently.


# Details #

I need someone to develop a GUI for NameGen, it is supposed to be used from the command line, but that doesn't appeal with everyone. Anyone who can write Python with PyGtk, please file an issue in the Issues tab above; stating that you can help. Much appreciated.
