NameGen gives you a whole new identity. Whether you want it for fun, or maybe just to sign up for something; you can get all you need from NameGen.


NameGen arose from the idea that generating fake names should be fast, easy, and from the command line _or_ a graphical user interface (GUI). All of the names are taken from U.S. Census Data, which is included with the build. NameGen is written in Python, and is compatible with Linux, Mac with Python, and (as far as I know) Windows with Python installed.

NameGen currently generates the following:

  * First Name
  * Middle Initial
  * Last Name
  * Mother's Maiden Name
  * Cell Phone and Home Phone (and carriers + location if possible)
  * SSN (_valid_, but **not real**)
Version 1.1.1+
  * Credit Card (MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover; _valid_, but not **real**)

Also check out OurPremise to see the NameGen idea. Visit <a href='http://code.google.com/p/difftime'>Difftime</a> when you have time. It's one of my other projects.
